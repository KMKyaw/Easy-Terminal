 I apologize for the confusion. It looks like you are trying to use a Windows shell command in a Linux environment. The `No` command is not recognized in Linux, and that's why you're getting the error message.

To fix this issue, you can replace the `No` command with the `echo` command, which is available in both Windows and Linux. Here's an updated version of the code snippet that should work in Linux:
```bash
`echo "hello world"`
```
This will print the string "hello world" to the console.</s>
